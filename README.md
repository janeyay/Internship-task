This is task 1, in this project i have created a vertical slider using prepend and appendchild() function along with MouseEventHandeler. What i have actually done is, i have arranged 5 cards vertically using flex column and with every drag after MouseDowwn the position of the mouse is calulated on the basis of initial position using offsetY function and final Y position is also calculated using the same function. Then the position is compared and two function upScroll() and downScroll() were called. The upScroll contains appendchild() function which append the first card in the last position and prepend in downScroll which append the last card in the first position.
